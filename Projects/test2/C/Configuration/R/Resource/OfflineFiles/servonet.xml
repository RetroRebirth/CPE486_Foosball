      <!-- 
        'maxRetry' is an optional element that allocates a portion of communication cycle for retries, which helps 
        ensure robust Mechatrolink communication in noisy environments.  However, the maximum number of Mechatrolink 
        nodes is reduced by this amount, so it should not be set unnecessarily high.        

        The default value is 1.
      -->
	  <maxRetry>1</maxRetry>

      <!-- 
        'baseStationAddress' is an optional element that indicates the
        address of the first M3 station in the IO map.  Legal M3
        station addresses span the range [0x03, 0xEF].  

        The node ID is calculated as

          nodeID = stationAddress - (baseStationAddress - 1)

        So, setting 'baseStationAddress' to something other than one 
        causes the nodeID to differ from the switch setting.

        The default value is 0x03.  The maximum value is 0xEF.

      <baseStationAddress>0x01</baseStationAddress>

      <!-- 
        'maxNumSlaves' is an optional element that indicates the
        length of JL100 IO map.  The IO map is automatically 
        generated by the JL100 device, and spans M3 station addresses 
        [baseStationAddress, baseStationAddress+maxNumSlaves-1].  Each
        slave in the IO map, whether connected or not, consumes
        a portion of the time available for the M3 communication
        cycle.  So, the length of the IO map must be kept consistent
        with the configured mlinkComm cycleTime.  (Generally, the MMA
        M3 network modeling tool should be used as a guide for
        configuring this value.)

        The default value is 16.  The maximum value is 62.

      <!--
        Maximum address of slaves to probe for auto-discovery. If left to the 
        default value (0), then it will probe only enough of the address space, 
        starting at baseStationAddress, to fill one block of (maxNumSlaves), 
        including any stations which are pre-reserved by the project 
        configuration. This ensures that auto-discovery startup takes the 
        minimum amount of time possible.      
      -->
      <maxDiscoverAddress>64</maxDiscoverAddress>

      <!-- 
        'tResponse' is an optional element that specifies the amount
        of time (in [10 nS] units) that the JL100 will wait for a
        response from each slave at startup.  If a slave address
        configured by the IO map is not detected at startup, this
        amount of time will be reserved for communication with a
        hot-plugged slave at that address.  Therefore, configuring a
        large value for tResponse may consume a large fraction of the
        M3 cycle time if many slaves configured in the IO map aren't
        present at startup. (Generally, the MMA M3 network modeling
        tool should be used as a guide for configuring this value.)

        The default value is 5000.  The maximum value is 65535.
